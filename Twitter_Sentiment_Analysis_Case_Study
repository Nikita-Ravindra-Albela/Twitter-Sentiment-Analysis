## Impact Section

##  Business Problem

Brands, marketers and product teams need to understand public sentiment in real-time (e.g., on social media) to respond to feedback, adapt campaigns and protect brand reputation. This project aims to classify tweets as positive or negative and deliver actionable insights around sentiment trends.

##  Analytical Approach

Loaded a real-world Twitter dataset and applied text-cleaning (removal of URLs, punctuation), lower-casing, tokenization and stemming using NLTK.

Transformed cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

Built a logistic regression classifier to predict tweet sentiment (positive vs negative).

Visualized sentiment distribution, frequent words, and word clouds using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall and F1-score.

##  Key Insights

The classifier achieved approximately 85–90% accuracy, showing strong predictive power for binary sentiment tasks.

Positive tweets slightly outnumbered negative ones in the dataset, suggesting a moderately optimistic tone overall.

Features engineered via TF-IDF outperformed simpler Bag-of-Words representations in capturing sentiment signals.

Text-cleaning (stemming, stop-word removal) significantly improved model performance by reducing noise.

##  Business Impact

This sentiment analysis pipeline can be packaged into a dashboard or reporting tool allowing brands to monitor social sentiment in real-time, enabling faster campaign pivots or customer feedback responses.

The model insights can drive marketing action (e.g., adjust messaging when negative sentiment spikes), brand reputation monitoring, or product-feature feedback loops.

Demonstrates proficiency in end-to-end NLP workflow—data ingestion → preprocessing → feature engineering → modeling → visualization—valuable for data-driven roles.
