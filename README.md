# üê¶ Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The goal is to classify tweets as **Positive** or **Negative** based on their textual content.  
This end-to-end analysis leverages text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and Logistic Regression modeling to understand public sentiment trends effectively.

## üéØ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess real-world tweet data using **NLTK**.
- Convert textual information into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**.
- Train and evaluate a **Logistic Regression** model for sentiment prediction.
- Visualize the distribution of sentiments and text characteristics using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

## üß† Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
The dataset containing tweets and sentiment labels is imported into a pandas DataFrame for exploration and preprocessing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Text data undergoes multiple cleaning stages:
- Removing special characters, URLs, and punctuation using **regular expressions**.  
- Converting text to lowercase for normalization.  
- Tokenization and stopword removal using **NLTK stopwords**.  
- Applying **Porter Stemming** to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").

```python
ps = PorterStemmer()
corpus = []
for tweet in data['tweet']:
    review = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', tweet)
    review = review.lower()
    review = review.split()
    review = [ps.stem(word) for word in review if word not in stopwords.words('english')]
    corpus.append(' '.join(review))
3. Feature Extraction
Transformed text corpus into numerical representation using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

This approach captures the importance of each term in the document relative to the entire corpus.

python
Copy code
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()
4. Model Training
Dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

Trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict tweet sentiment.

python
Copy code
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
5. Model Evaluation
Performance metrics used:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

The model achieved strong predictive performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of text vectorization and Logistic Regression for sentiment classification tasks.

üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized key insights from the dataset:

Sentiment distribution (positive vs negative tweets)

Most frequent words across sentiments

Word cloud representations for positive and negative tweets

Example visualization:

python
Copy code
sns.countplot(x='label', data=data)
plt.title('Distribution of Sentiments')
plt.show()
üßæ Results Summary
Achieved ~85‚Äì90% accuracy (depending on dataset size and preprocessing).

Observed that positive tweets are slightly more frequent than negative ones.

Text cleaning and stemming significantly improved model performance by reducing noise.

TF-IDF performed better than simple Bag-of-Words for feature extraction.

ü™Ñ Key Insights
Logistic Regression, despite being a linear model, performs strongly on text classification when combined with TF-IDF.

Preprocessing steps like stemming and stopword removal are crucial for reducing vocabulary redundancy.

Sentiment analysis can serve as a foundational approach for brand reputation tracking, political opinion analysis, and customer feedback monitoring.
